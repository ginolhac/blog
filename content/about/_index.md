Hi, I am a bioinfomatician at the [Life Sciences Research Unit](http://wwwen.uni.lu/recherche/fstc/life_sciences_research_unit/people/aurelien_ginolhac) at the [University of Luxembourg](http://wwwen.uni.lu/).

I am mostly interested in R, data science, bike commuting and geeky stuffs such as raspberry pis. I live in France, father of two.

This blog was built using the [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package and [rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/). The [hugo](http://www.gohugo.io/) theme `cactus-plus` was designed by [nodejh](https://github.com/nodejh/hugo-theme-cactus-plus), thanks to [Thomas Pedersen](https://www.data-imaginist.com/) for chosing it, was a good one.
