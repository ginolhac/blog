This page is dedicated to tabs from the
band [karate][southern] made by fans. These tabs
came from the original [website][willem].  
[Geoff Farina][geoff] is the Karate's guitarist, many thanks to him for writing such nice songs.
Have fun playing the incredible music made by
Karate and please feel free to correct the tabs by sending an email to his author if you find
any mistakes or new interpretations.
